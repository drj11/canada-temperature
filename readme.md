Environment Canada weather stations indexed by the StationID used in the web user interface.  See for example, "this one":http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/monthlydata_e.html?timeframe=3&Prov=XX&StationID=10813&Year=2010&Month=10&Day=25.

Note almost no useful metadata is scraped (because it's not on web pages);
primarily intended as a feed into the "canada temperature data scraper":http://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/canada-temperature-data/.
